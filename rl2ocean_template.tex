% A template for students and masters dissertations, flexible for your
% needs.
%
% This is the main .tex which will tell the compiler to include everything, 
% each chapter/section is then in folders for convenience, as you include more 
% images it can get harder and harder to manage.
%
% First things first, declaration of the document class along with the packages % we need.
%
% P.S. Sorry about the back to the future references, I used them to show some 
% example work possible

%KEEP THIS ONE LAST it's quite buggy, it allows you to click on links within the pdf and web links without changing the colour. The mouse cursor simply changes its icon to indicate to the user. Great tool - still awkward
